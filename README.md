# KNN-Perceptron-SVM-PA

In this project, I implement classification algorithms.
There is 4 algorithms:
- KNN (k-nearest neighbors)
- Perceptron
- SVM
- PA 

For each algorithm I implemented train method and test method.
Finally, I choose hyper-parameters by using K-fold method, which brought me high success rates.


**Instructions for how to run and use the code:**

Install the following package:
```
pip install numpy
 ```
 Now, run the command:<br/>
